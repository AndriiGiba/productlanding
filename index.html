        <h1> How to Be the Good Kind of Beginner</h1>
    <p class="title">Above and Beyond</p>
    <p>Before paddling out, spend at least 30 minutes watching the surf. You’ll
        want to watch where other surfers paddle out, where the waves are
        breaking, and the ability level of the people in the water. Are they all very
        advanced, or are there beginners as well? You need to make sure that the
        waves are a comfortable size for you—and sometimes it takes 30 minutes
        or more to see how big the bigger sets are. Once you paddle out, sit off to
        the side and watch for a little longer, noting where people are catching waves.

            I went climbing at Clymb in yas island yesterday and I must say that I am extremely impressed.
             All staff from the main reception, to the gear reception and the instructor. The facility itself
              is very impressive! Seeing the walls in person is different because you don't quite grasp just 
              how long they are until you see them. My instructor on the day Mr. Tabs was extremely professional
               and patient. He did not try to rush me through anything and gave me lots of tips as a beginner. 
               For anyone thats planning on going I highly recommend it and they do have some discounts (Fazaa etc) and packages as well!
